# Purpose
Demonstration of filtering by multiple criteria for a table of data.  In this case, UFO sightings.  Also demonstrates transition as the page loads and the UFO descends.

NOTE:  Original commits were done to the javascript-challenge repo but it would not publish without re-organizing folders so this repo was created after coding was completed.
